    "#### Scope\n",
    "This is the project which will be implemented the RAG approach to customize the chatbot using the provided dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data source\n",
    "The dataset named 'character_descriptions.csv' is the file contained the characters information such as name, short description, medium and setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reason for selection\n",
    "I chose this dataset because it includes character descriptions from theater, television, and film productions, all created by an OpenAI model. Since the dataset doesn't exist in real life, the LLM won't have prior knowledge of it, making it ideal for testing the RAG approach. Additionally, if the LLM generates hallucinated answers, we can easily trace and compare them with the grounded answers."
